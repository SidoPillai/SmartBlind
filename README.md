# SmartBlind
Smart Blind is an IOT application using raspberry pi as a server. <br>
The android client lets you view the current temperature and light intensity of the room
from the pi's temperature and light sensitive sensors.<br>
You can interact with the physical world by performing an action on the sensors.<br>

# Features
1. Add fuzzy rules to define blind action e.g. to close the when it is bright and temperature is cold. 
2. Get push notifications for every 2 degree change in temperature. 
3. 3-D touch to view application temperature and light intensity on the app.
